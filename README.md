# Snap Revision Game
A snap revision game for Computer Science OCR GCSE covering a range of modules.

**IMPORTANT - DO NOT MOVE THE *.txt* FILES OUT FROM THE MAIN DIRECTORY, AS THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND THE SCRIPTS WILL BREAK IF ALL THE *.txt* FILES ARE NOT IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE *snap_main.py* AND *snap_ext.py* FILES.**

v0.2 Patch Notes
The game is now fully functional but is entirely text based and has some minor spacing errors. The GUI will be implemented using TKinter at a later date.
The user can now add new questions and answers to the game to lengthen its lifespan.
